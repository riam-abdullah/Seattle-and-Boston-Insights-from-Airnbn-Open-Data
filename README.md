# Capstone Project: Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services
In this project, I analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. I used unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, I used supervised machine learning techniques to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company.  Finally the results were summarized in a Medium blog post found here: https://medium.com/@riamyahya/customer-segmentation-for-arvato-financial-services-ceac3db47574?sk=e0dc366767747d47f1473ac73f940d96
